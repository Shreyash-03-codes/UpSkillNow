      <p class="fs-5 text-muted story-paragraph">
        My name is <strong>Shreyash Gurav</strong> and I'm an aspiring <strong>Java Full Stack Developer</strong>. This website is not just a platformâ€”it's a piece of my story.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5 text-muted story-paragraph">
        When I began my journey into programming, I was overwhelmed. Everyone around me seemed to be doing something greatâ€”DSA, Java, Web Dev, or competitive programmingâ€”but I had no idea where or how to start. I searched for roadmaps, tutorials, or anything that could guide me step-by-step. Most of what I found was either scattered or too complex.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5 text-muted story-paragraph">
        I remember struggling with basic syntax errors in Java, trying to build even the simplest of programs. I'd spend hours on one bug just to realize it was a missing semicolon. While others had mentors or communities, I often felt like I was walking this path alone.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5 text-muted story-paragraph">
        But what I didn't realize then was that these struggles were building me into a stronger developer. Every small successâ€”be it printing a pattern, creating a simple form in HTML, or finally understanding recursionâ€”felt like winning a battle. Slowly, I built my foundation.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5 text-muted story-paragraph">
        <strong>UpSkillNow</strong> was born from this journey. It's a place I created to ensure no beginner feels the confusion I once did. Whether you're learning <strong>Java, DSA, Web Development, DevOps, or System Design</strong>, this platform is structured, simple, and made by someone who's been in your shoes.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5 text-muted story-paragraph">
        You'll find guided paths, code challenges, notes, and reminders to stay consistent. The goal? To give you a clear direction and a strong push, just like I wish someone gave me.
      </p>

        "Turn confusion into confidence â€” one line of code at a time."
